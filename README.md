# Sneaks-
#Sneaker application for managing sneaker prices and releases from multiple resell sites. 


Find My Sneaks

Capstone Project for PDX Codeguild

Overview:
I will be building the Find my Sneaks App to track sneaker prices and releases.  Thereâ€™s a huge sneaker community from collectors to resellers that micromanage and follow the latest sneakers and releases. The idea is provide a site that tracks release dates on the most popular sneakers and brands from the top resell sites (Flight Club, Stockx, and Goat).  The application can be used for pure monitoring or compiling a tracker for yourself to get sneaker prices at price drops.  There will also be a sms notification option for price drops using Twilo API.
